title: Simulating Globalisation in the Roman Empire
---
The Roman Empire was one of the principal globalised political entities in history. While not directly comparable with modern world-wide globalisation, large-scale connectivity allowed Rome to maintain its socio-economic, military, political and cultural dominance over dozens of cultures, languages, religions and ethnicities in an area comparable to the modern-day EU (Horden and Purcell 2000; Pitts and Versluys 2014a). In its constituent regions, globalisation induced profound, complex and variable societal changes, emerging from the interplay between local conditions (environment, demography, subsistence economy) and ‘global’ factors, including epidemics, climate change and power struggles within the Empire. Understanding the interactions between regional dynamics and global trends is key to comprehend globalisation in the Roman world. For a long time, the debate about the Empire’s social and economic history has been dominated by large-scale generalizing theories based on coarse-grained datasets (Erdkamp 2005; Scheidel and Friesen 2009; Temin 2013; Harper 2017). Consequently, socio-economic narratives of its regions are often disconnected and lack a formal analysis of the impact of globalisation. The significant increase in high-resolution archaeological data over the last few decades (e.g. Mees and Polak 2013; Allen et al. 2017; Reddé 2017), however, now allows for the development of more encompassing theories that address the interdependency and interactions of the local and global sphere
